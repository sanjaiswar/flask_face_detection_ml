Students those who are working on data science projects that are based on python, they can use flask framework to create their projects.

This project covers all basic setup and methods to work with web based projects, so that you can deploy your project and demonstrate live during your viva or interviews

For face detection I have used haarcascade frontalface dataset

Create a seperate folder called datasets in project folder

Create reg_face.html, capture_preview.html and detect_face.html 

I have defined following routes and functions 

regFace()

capturePreview()

video_feed()

createDataset()

detectFace()
detect_preview()
